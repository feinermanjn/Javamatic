Coding Exercise for Northern Trust

Simulates a coffee machine, with 6 drinks (Caffe Americano, Caffe Latte, Caffe Mocha, Cappuccino, Coffee, Decaf Coffee) made from combinations of 9 ingredients (Cocoa, Coffee, Cream, Decaf Coffee, Espresso, Foamed Milk, Steamed Milk, Sugar, Whipped Cream).

There are 10 units of each ingredient. Users can dispense a drink, as long as it is in stock (meaning that there are enough units of the ingredients required in order to make it). Users can also enter 'R' or 'r' to restock the machine, setting the quantities of each ingredient to 10. The command 'Q' or 'q' will quit the program.
